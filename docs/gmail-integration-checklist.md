## Pre-Deployment Setup

### Google Cloud Platform Setup

- [ ] Google project created specifically for production
- [ ] OAuth consent screen configured with proper branding
- [ ] Application verified by Google (for accessing sensitive scopes)
- [ ] Production OAuth credentials generated
- [ ] Domain verification completed
- [ ] API quotas reviewed and increased if necessary
- [ ] Billing account linked and monitored

### Application Configuration

- [ ] Environment variables set for production credentials
  - [ ] `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID`
  - [ ] `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - [ ] `GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI` (production URL)
- [ ] Database schema migrations prepared
- [ ] Feature flags configured (if using a phased rollout)
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented for API endpoints

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] Secure storage of OAuth tokens in database
  - [ ] Access tokens encrypted at rest
  - [ ] Refresh tokens encrypted at rest
- [ ] Database access properly restricted
- [ ] User session validation before accessing Gmail data
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism tested in production-like environment
- [ ] Logout/disconnect functionality removes tokens

### Data Security

- [ ] All API requests use HTTPS
- [ ] OAuth state parameter used to prevent CSRF attacks
- [ ] No sensitive data logged (token values, email contents)
- [ ] Email attachments properly sanitized
- [ ] Temporary files cleaned up after processing
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented on all forms
- [ ] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### Code Security

- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security-focused code review completed
- [ ] Input validation on all API parameters
- [ ] Proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive details
- [ ] Secrets management solution implemented

## Privacy Compliance

### User Consent

- [ ] Clear user consent flow for Gmail access
- [ ] Transparent explanation of data usage
- [ ] Ability to revoke access easily
- [ ] Data retention policy clearly communicated

### Data Handling

- [ ] Only minimum required scopes requested
- [ ] Data minimization principles applied (only extract necessary data)
- [ ] Email content not stored unless necessary
- [ ] Automatic purging of raw email content after processing
- [ ] PDF attachments securely handled and not persisted unnecessarily

### Compliance Documentation

- [ ] Privacy policy updated to reflect Gmail data usage
- [ ] Terms of service updated if necessary
- [ ] Data processing agreements in place if required
- [ ] GDPR compliance measures documented
- [ ] Right to be forgotten implementation tested

## Performance Optimization

### Efficiency

- [ ] Batch operations used where appropriate
- [ ] Caching implemented for token status and other frequent checks
- [ ] Background processing for email analysis
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent Gmail API quota exhaustion
- [ ] Lazy loading of emails to improve performance

### Scalability

- [ ] Database indexes created for email and order queries
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Horizontal scaling strategy defined
- [ ] Queue system for processing large volumes of emails

## Operational Readiness

### Monitoring

- [ ] Logging configured for all Gmail API interactions
- [ ] Error tracking integrated (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket)
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] API quota usage monitoring
- [ ] Alerting for critical failures

### Documentation

- [ ] Architecture documentation updated
- [ ] API endpoint documentation completed
- [ ] Runbook created for common operational tasks
- [ ] Known limitations documented
- [ ] User documentation and guides prepared

### Support Readiness

- [ ] Common troubleshooting scenarios documented
- [ ] Support team trained on Gmail integration features
- [ ] FAQ prepared for end-users
- [ ] Contact established with Google API support (if enterprise)

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Testing

- [ ] OAuth flow works in production environment
- [ ] Email fetching works with production credentials
- [ ] Token refresh succeeds in production
- [ ] Email processing functions correctly
- [ ] Order data correctly extracted and stored
- [ ] Disconnection flow works properly

### Non-Functional Testing

- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Resource utilization monitored (memory, CPU)
- [ ] Error rates below threshold
- [ ] Response times acceptable under load
- [ ] Graceful degradation verified

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers

- [ ] Define criteria for initiating rollback
  - [ ] Error rate exceeds X%
  - [ ] Critical security vulnerability discovered
  - [ ] Data processing issues affecting user experience
  - [ ] OAuth flow failures above threshold

### Rollback Process

- [ ] Database rollback procedures documented
- [ ] Feature flag toggle prepared for quick disabling
- [ ] Communication templates ready for user notification
- [ ] Team roles and responsibilities defined for rollback scenario
- [ ] Tested rollback procedure in staging environment

### Post-Rollback

- [ ] Analysis plan for identifying root cause
- [ ] Data recovery procedures if needed
- [ ] User communication strategy for service updates
- [ ] Timeline for resolution and re-deployment
