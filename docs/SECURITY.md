# Security Documentation

## Security Measures Implemented

### ✅ Environment Variable Security

#### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **Removed Client-Side API Key Exposure**
   - Changed `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` to server-side only `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY`
   - Removed API key from `next.config.js` env section
   - **Impact**: Prevents API key from being exposed in client-side JavaScript

2. **Production Debug Mode Disabled**
   - NextAuth debug mode now only enabled in development
   - **Impact**: Prevents sensitive authentication details from appearing in production logs

3. **Environment-Aware Logging**
   - Session data logging restricted to development only
   - Database query parameter logging secured
   - **Impact**: Prevents sensitive user data from appearing in production logs

### ✅ Security Headers

Implemented comprehensive security headers in `next.config.js`:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS protection

### ✅ Database Security

- Enhanced Prisma logging with security considerations
- Production error logging sanitized to avoid data exposure
- Query parameter logging restricted to development

### ✅ Debug Endpoint Security

- Debug API endpoints now disabled in production by default
- Can be enabled in production only with explicit `ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS=true` environment variable
- Sensitive data (HTML content, error details) hidden in production responses
- **Endpoints secured**: `/api/debug/test-gmail-api`, `/api/debug/download-screenshot`

## Environment Variables

### Required Environment Variables
See `.env.example` for complete list with security notes.

### Security Guidelines:
- ❌ **NEVER** use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for sensitive API keys
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use server-side only environment variables for secrets
- ✅ **ROTATE** API keys and secrets regularly
- ✅ **USE** different credentials for development and production

### New Environment Variables for Security:
- `ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS` - Set to `true` to enable debug endpoints in production (not recommended)

## Ongoing Security Considerations

### High Priority (Not Yet Implemented):
1. **Token Encryption at Rest**
   - OAuth tokens stored in plain text in database
   - Recommendation: Implement encryption for sensitive fields

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - API endpoints lack rate limiting
   - Recommendation: Implement rate limiting for all API routes

3. **Input Validation**
   - Audit all API endpoints for proper input validation
   - Recommendation: Use schema validation libraries

### Medium Priority:
1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Implement strict CSP headers
   - Monitor and prevent XSS attacks

2. **API Authentication**
   - Ensure all sensitive API routes require authentication
   - Implement proper authorization checks

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Implement security event logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activities

## Security Checklist for Deployment

### Before Production Deployment:
- [x] Verify all API keys are server-side only
- [x] Ensure debug modes are disabled
- [x] Check that sensitive data is not logged
- [x] Validate security headers are in place
- [x] Secure debug endpoints for production
- [ ] Test OAuth flows with production credentials
- [ ] Verify database connections are secure
- [ ] Review and rotate all secrets

### Regular Security Maintenance:
- [ ] Monthly API key rotation
- [ ] Quarterly security dependency updates
- [ ] Regular security audits of new features
- [ ] Monitor application logs for security events

## Recent Security Updates

### Latest Changes (High Priority Fixes):
1. **API Key Exposure Fixed** - Roboflow API key no longer exposed to client-side
2. **Debug Mode Secured** - NextAuth debug mode disabled in production
3. **Logging Sanitized** - Session and database logging secured for production
4. **Security Headers Added** - Comprehensive HTTP security headers implemented
5. **Debug Endpoints Secured** - Debug API routes disabled in production by default

## Incident Response

In case of suspected security breach:
1. Immediately rotate all API keys and secrets
2. Review application logs for suspicious activity
3. Check database for any unauthorized access
4. Update affected users if necessary
5. Document incident and update security measures
