### Post-deploy fixes and hardening (January 9, 2025)

- OAuth redirect to localhost fixed in production
  - Updated Vercel envs: `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://vera-prod-six.vercel.app`, `GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI=https://vera-prod-six.vercel.app/api/auth/gmail/callback`
  - Google Cloud OAuth client updated with production redirect URIs and authorized origins
  - Implemented dynamic redirect resolution in `src/lib/gmail-auth.ts` (prefers `GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI`, then `NEXTAUTH_URL`, then `VERCEL_URL`) and pass `redirect_uri` explicitly in `generateAuthUrl`
  - Mobile and incognito logins now redirect to production domain
- Removed client-side exposure of Roboflow API key
  - Switched from `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` to server-side `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY`
  - Removed client `env` exposure from `next.config.js`
- Security hardening
  - Added security headers in `next.config.js` (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, X-XSS-Protection)
  - Disabled NextAuth debug logs in production; restricted session and Prisma query logging to development
  - Gated debug API routes behind `ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS` in production
  - Added `.env.example` and `docs/SECURITY.md` with guidelines
- Server-side base URL fallback improvements
  - Updated `src/lib/image-utils.ts` to prefer `NEXTAUTH_URL` or `VERCEL_URL` over localhost in server-side calls

### Forwarded email support and parser upgrades (August 8, 2025)

- Forwarded e-commerce emails (H&M, Myntra, Zara) are now discovered and processed via the connected Gmail account.
  - Fetch API (`src/app/api/gmail/fetch-emails/route.ts`):
    - Runs two searches in parallel and merges results: tight brand-sender query AND a forward-friendly query.
    - Forward query uses `in:anywhere` + `includeSpamTrash: true` and requires brand tokens together with order keywords or Fwd/FW markers to avoid noise (e.g., Swiggy).
    - De-duplicates by message id and sorts by date.
  - Processing API (`src/app/api/gmail/process-myntra-emails/route.ts`):
    - Uses a broadened, forward-aware query by default with the same brand + order constraints and includes spam/trash.
- Parser improvements for forwarded emails:
  - Added subject normalization and forwarded-content unwrapping in Gmail service (`src/lib/gmail-service.ts`) so parsers see the original retailer subject/body despite FW/Fwd wrappers.
  - H&M parser (`src/lib/custom-parsers.ts`) enhanced to handle forwarded HTML structure:
    - Detects parcel-api wrapped links and decodes the embedded `productpage.*` URL from the `to=` parameter.
    - Extracts product name, price, Art. No., color, size, and quantity from the anchor’s nested detail table, with image from the adjacent column.
    - Skips promos (e.g., "Complete the look") and de-duplicates by art number/product link.
- Net result: Users can forward order confirmations to the connected Gmail and have items reliably fetched and parsed alongside normal retailer emails.

### URL product add flow (August 9, 2025)

- Implemented URL-based add for retailer product pages with confirmation modal.
  - Supports Myntra and H&M product URLs; scrapes name, price, image, color, category.
  - Confirmation modal allows editing brand/name/category before save.
- Backend improvements
  - `/api/wardrobe` now accepts `{ url }` and edited items (single or array).
  - Duplicate-safe logic (unique on `userId, brand, name, size`) updates existing items instead of erroring.
  - H&M scraper enhanced for reliability (selectors for name/price/image/color).
- Performance improvements
  - Added DB index `@@index([userId, dateAdded])` to speed wardrobe fetch ordering.
  - UI stops refetching full wardrobe after save; appends returned items directly.
- Status: URL fetch working for Myntra and H&M; category edits persist via modal. 

### Zara URL fetch fixes and performance (August 9, 2025)

- Resolved Akamai interstitials blocking static fetches by adding a headless fallback for Zara pages.
- Performance improvements for Zara:
  - Reuse a single Puppeteer browser across requests.
  - Block heavy resources (images, media, fonts, stylesheets) during navigation.
  - Short, bounded waits instead of full page hydration.
  - 6-hour in-memory HTML cache by URL.
- Data extraction:
  - Prefer JSON-LD Product data; fallback to `og:`/Twitter meta.
  - Normalize absolute image URLs; stable product id from `pNNNNNNNN`.
- Result:
  - Cold hit ~5–6s; warm/cached hits faster.
- Files touched: `src/lib/scrape-product.ts` (Zara path + performance), added `puppeteer` dependency. 

### Batch email fetch now captures forwarded emails (August 11, 2025)

- Fixed “Add all items to wardrobe” missing forwarded emails.
  - Updated `src/lib/email-retrieval.ts` to use a dual-query strategy (primary retailer sender + forward-aware `in:anywhere` with brand tokens and FW/Fwd markers), aligned with `/api/gmail/fetch-emails`.
  - Enabled `includeSpamTrash: true` and wrapped composed query to improve matching.
- Impact: Forwarded H&M/Myntra/Zara emails are now discovered and processed in batch, matching single-email behavior.
- Commit: fixed fetching in batch from forwarded emails 

### Save function payload fix (August 11, 2025)

- Addressed failures when saving large wardrobes due to oversized request/response payloads.
  - Client now sends only diffs (create/update/delete) in small chunks; deletes use targeted DELETE calls.
  - Server `POST /api/wardrobe/save` response trimmed to only `{ message, count }` to reduce response size.
  - Updated `email-debug` add flow to post items in chunks to `/api/wardrobe`.
- Impact: Reliable saves for large wardrobes; avoids 413/size limits and improves perceived performance.
- Commit: save function fixed 

### Photo upload flow with smart cropping (August 11, 2025)

- Implemented user-facing upload from photos with multi-image selection and review.
- Cropping pipeline:
  - Primary: Roboflow Detect API to get garment bbox; crop via sharp (headers: X-Detection-Class, X-Detection-Confidence, X-Crop-Method).
  - Fallback: heuristic percent-based crops per item type when detection unavailable.
  - Added `auto` mode in `/api/extract-item` to choose highest-confidence class without name bias.
- UI/UX:
  - New `UploadWardrobeItems` CTA with camera icon; opens file picker and processes images.
  - Reuses existing `ConfirmationModal`; added per-item toggle to switch cropped/original image.
  - Auto-naming currently from detected class (e.g., "shirt", "jeans"); user can edit in modal.
- Persistence and immediacy:
  - On confirm, items are posted to `/api/wardrobe` with `source: 'photo'`.
  - Immediate UI update: appended saved items to `products` state (no refresh required).
- Files:
  - API: `src/app/api/extract-item/route.ts` (auto mode, fallbacks)
  - UI: `src/components/UploadWardrobeItems.tsx` (new), `src/components/ConfirmationFlow/ConfirmationModal.tsx` (toggle)
  - Page integration: `src/app/page.tsx` (CTA + onSaved append)
- Status: Working end-to-end locally; build green. Next: optional color-aware names (e.g., "red shirt") via `getColorInfo`.
