## üéØ **Recent Major Changes (August 13, 2025)**

### **New: Authentication System & Onboarding Implementation - COMPLETED**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive authentication system with smart onboarding flow successfully implemented

  - Proper loading states and error handling
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Added `showOnboarding` state to track onboarding status
  - Implemented `checkOnboardingStatus()` function to check Gmail connection
  - Conditional rendering of OnboardingFlow component

- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/app/page.tsx` - Added onboarding status check and conditional rendering
  - `src/components/OnboardingFlow.tsx` - Simplified component with main page handling logic
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning to prevent browser extension conflicts
- **Authentication Flow**:
  - Clean sign-in page for unauthenticated users
  - Seamless transition to onboarding for new users
  - Direct access to main dashboard for existing users
  - Proper session cleanup on sign-out
- **Testing Confirmed**: Authentication flow works correctly, onboarding only shows for new users, existing users skip onboarding

### **New: My Gallery Page Implementation - COMPLETED**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - My Gallery page successfully implemented and tested
- **Navigation Addition**: Added "My Gallery" to left sidebar with Image icon from lucide-react
- **Dedicated Route**: Created `/gallery` page with proper layout and consistent styling
- **Component Relocation**: Moved FullBodyPhotoUpload from homepage to dedicated gallery page
- **Homepage Cleanup**: Removed FullBodyPhotoUpload section to streamline homepage layout
- **Testing Confirmed**: Gallery page loads successfully, navigation works correctly, component renders properly
- **Design Consistency**: Applied same styling patterns as other dedicated pages (Calendar, Packs, etc.)
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/components/LeftNavigation.tsx` - Added My Gallery navigation item
  - `src/app/gallery/page.tsx` - New gallery page implementation
  - `src/app/page.tsx` - Removed FullBodyPhotoUpload component
  - `PROGRESS.md` - Updated documentation

### **New: Wardrobe Page + Editor & UI Improvements**
- **Wardrobe page**: Moved the wardrobe section from the home dashboard to a dedicated route ` /wardrobe ` and wired the left nav link. Kept search/filters intact. Removed duplicate titles and matched heading style with Outfits/Calendar.
- **Header glass + search**: Implemented frosted glass header (`bg-[#fdfcfa]/80`, `backdrop-blur-md`, subtle border) and matched the search input to `@UI redone` with `bg-input-background`, muted placeholder, rounded-full, and proper focus ring outside the container (no cropping).
- **Suggested Outfits**: Now renders real saved outfits from `/api/outfits`. If none exist, it generates fallback suggestions by collaging random wardrobe items from `/api/wardrobe`. Removed match/tags; kept name and description. Added CTAs: "Schedule" (calendar icon) and "Pack" (package icon).
- **Outfit thumbnails (auto)**: On save, if no try-on image exists, we capture a high-DPI screenshot of the outfit canvas and save it as the thumbnail. Implemented smart-crop: compute tight bounding box of placed items and crop with a small margin so items are centered with minimal whitespace.
- **Prevent overlay persistence**: The saved try-on/thumbnail is no longer placed back onto the canvas when loading an outfit. Also excluded any temporary overlays from screenshots and clear them after save to avoid them being captured or re-saved.
- **Wardrobe API fix**: Standardized to Prisma `Wardrobe` model and consistent `authOptions` import; resolves "Failed to load wardrobe" errors.
- **Modal/CTA polish**: Rounded "Save"/"Cancel" in item modal to match other CTAs.

### **1. Database Persistence Fix for Wardrobe Updates - COMPLETED**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Fixed wardrobe item updates not persisting after page refresh
- **Problem**: Changes made in the item details modal were only saved to local state, not to the database
- **Solution**: Implemented proper database persistence using PUT API endpoint
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added PUT method to `/api/wardrobe` route to handle item updates
  - Modified `handleSave` function in `NewWardrobeSection` to call the API before updating local state
  - Ensured database is updated before closing the modal
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback
- **Result**: Wardrobe item changes now persist across page refreshes and browser sessions

### **2. Saved Outfits Error Fix - COMPLETED**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')" error
- **Problem**: The API now returns outfits without the `items` array for the list endpoint, but the component assumed `outfit.items` existed
- **Solution**: Made thumbnail rendering resilient by checking if `items` exists before using it
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed debug code that iterated over `outfit.items.filter(...)`
  - Added fallback logic: if `tryOnImage` exists, show it; else if `items` exists and has length > 0, render item-based thumb; else show placeholder
  - Fixed inline style typo in the component

### **3. Sticky Header Implementation - COMPLETED**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Header now stays fixed at top while scrolling
- **Problem**: Header was moving with scroll instead of staying fixed and overlapping the left navigation
- **Solution**: Changed header positioning from `sticky` to `fixed` with proper z-index
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `NewHeader` component to use `fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50`
  - Adjusted main content top padding to `pt-16` to account for fixed header height
  - Header now properly overlaps left navigation and stays in place during scroll

### **4. Background Removal Feature - COMPLETELY REMOVED**
- **Status**: ‚ùå **REVERTED** - All background removal functionality has been completely removed
- **Reason**: User requested to go back to the previous approach
- **Files Removed**:
  - `src/lib/onnx/session.ts` - ONNX session helper
  - `src/lib/canvas.ts` - Canvas utilities  
  - `src/workers/removeBg.worker.ts` - Background removal web worker
  - `src/hooks/useBackgroundRemoval.ts` - React hook for background removal
  - `src/components/BackgroundRemover.tsx` - Background removal UI component
  - `src/app/tools/remove-background/page.tsx` - Demo page
  - `src/app/api/remove-bg/route.ts` - Server-side background removal API

- **Changes**:
  - Removed "Upload an item" button from wardrobe section
  - Restored original `UploadWardrobeItems` component using `/api/extract-item` endpoint

- **Current Flow**: Users can upload items via the original server-side processing

### **6. UI Enhancements - COMPLETED**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - New weather and location widgets added
- **Features Added**:
  - **Location & Time Widget**: Shows Mumbai, India location with current date and time
  - **Weather Widget**: Displays current temperature (28¬∞C), condition (Partly Cloudy), and feels like temperature
  - **Responsive Design**: Widgets stack vertically on small screens, side-by-side on larger screens
  - **Enhanced Spacing**: Increased spacing between widgets and greeting title (mb-16)
- **Positioning**: Widgets are displayed above the greeting title

### **7. Edit Packs View Styling - COMPLETED**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Improved styling and functionality of Edit Pack view
- **Changes Made**:
  - **Font and Spacing**: Updated to use `font-serif` and `font-normal` for consistency with other pages
  - **Duplicate Title Fix**: Removed duplicate "Edit Pack" title from the page component
  - **Button Styling**: Updated "Cancel" and "Update Pack" buttons to match other CTAs (black/white, rounded-full)
  - **Outfit Thumbnails**: Fixed issue where preview thumbnails weren't showing by ensuring `tryOnImage` is selected in API
  - **Layout Improvements**: Better spacing, padding, and responsive grid layouts

### **8. Horizontal Scroll Issues - RESOLVED**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Fixed horizontal scrolling problems across the application
- **Problem**: Left navigation was causing horizontal scroll on homepage and other pages
- **Solution**: Applied comprehensive overflow control and width constraints
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added global CSS rules for `overflow-x: hidden`
  - Updated layout components with proper width constraints
  - Added `overflow-hidden` to individual component sections
  - Fixed carousel and grid containers to prevent overflow

### **9. Header Gap Reduction - COMPLETED**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Reduced excessive spacing between header and page content
- **Changes Made**:
  - Reduced main content top padding from `pt-20` to `pt-16` initially
  - Further reduced to `pt-8` based on user feedback
  - Final adjustment to `pt-16` to accommodate fixed header positioning
